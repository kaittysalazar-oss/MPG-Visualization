# City vs Highway MPG Visualization in R

This project explores the relationship between **city and highway fuel efficiency** using the EPA's `mpg` dataset.  
It demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis and create professional data visualizations using **R**, **dplyr**, and **ggplot2**.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:
- Visualizing trends between city and highway MPG.
- Highlighting differences by the number of cylinders.
- Comparing average city MPG by manufacturer.
- Applying custom themes and color palettes for presentation-quality visuals.

The project is designed to reflect real-world data storytelling — transforming a raw dataset into clear, visual insights that would be suitable for dashboards or presentations.
